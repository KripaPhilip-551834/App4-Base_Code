Brief Description of Goal of Code:
Through this code, we aim to provide a 4-question diagnostic tool for individuals to use to determine whether they have a likelihood of getting their period in the next 5 days or not. Based on their yes or no answers for the 4 diagnostic questions, the app presents the likelihood of getting their period in the next 5 days or not. The app is meant to be used by users who have frequent periods, and assumes that such users do not have certain reproductive disorders or preexisting medical conditions. The code is meant to be used by individuals to plan ahead and carry period products with them at the risk that they get their period soon.
 
Known Issues:
The known issues are that likely the individual may not be able to put all symptoms into the app and thus the app is not 100% comprehensive in diagnosing an individual. This code does not take into account many other factors that might affect period frequency including the presence of certain reproductive disorders, age of user, sexual activity of user, or sex at birth of user. The app rather asks surface level questions to gauge whether an individual might have an upcoming period.
